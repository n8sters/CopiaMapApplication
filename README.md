# CopiaMapApplication
Hello!

Built as part of the application process for the Copia Android Intern position, this application reads from an 
internal JSON file, updates the position of a custom-icon marker every 0.5 seconds.

A Google Maps v2 API key is needed to run the application, it can be placed in the google_maps_api.xml file,
just replace the "xxx" placeholder. 

Cheers!
